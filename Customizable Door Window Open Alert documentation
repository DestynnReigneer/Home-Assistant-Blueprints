Home Assistant: Customizable Door/Window Open Alert
This blueprint sends a configurable, actionable notification if a door, window, or any other binary sensor is left open for a specified duration. It's a universal alert system that allows you to customize messages, button options, and time delays for various use cases around your home.

Features
Universal Sensor: Works with any binary_sensor entity (e.g., door, window, garage, motion sensor).
Actionable Notifications: The alert notification includes three customizable buttons for user interaction.
Customizable Messages: All messages, titles, and button labels can be configured to fit your specific needs (e.g., "Front Door Left Open" vs. "Laundry is Done").
Configurable Delays: Set the initial trigger time and the re-notification delays for each button option.
Optional Closing Action: Can be configured to send a command to close a device (like a cover or switch) and confirm the action.

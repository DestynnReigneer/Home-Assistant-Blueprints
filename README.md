# Home-Assistant-Blueprints
The purpose of this Blueprint is to establish mission critical notifications to all needed devices for resolution in protecting infrastructure and assets. Examples are, doors, windows, garages, safes, pool gates, etcâ€¦ If it can be left open for periods of time and can be a cause for concern and need immediate resolution. This is a one-stop-shop that makes use of the notification system, presents choices to the user with options and simple intelligence to nudge the user to complete an action. The action will be continuously nagging for a resolution, and if all else fails perform the action needed to resolve the alarm. The notifications are meant for multiple users, and designed to inform others that did not respond to the notification, what action was taken or not taken by a user or no users. If nobody responds, then the users all receive a continuous message (nudge) in hopes to resolve the issue. If capable of resolving and no response, the action taken by HA, and will then notify all users of the outcome. Likewise if a user makes a decision, all users are notified of that decision. If this decision is not resolved it loops back through, if it is, a resolved notification is sent. Repetitive nags are necessary in order to force the behavior required to secure sensitive object(s).
